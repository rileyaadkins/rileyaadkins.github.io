        My name is Riley Adkins. I am a aspiring Web-Developer in Columbus, OH.
        I am currently enrolled as a full-stack Java student at We Can Code IT.
        I come from a background of working as a licensed Cosmetologist since
        2014. Due to my background I have been enjoying front-end development
        (CSS, HTML) because of my attention to detail and design. I believe I
        have many transferable skills to the development world. I enjoy keeping
        up with new trends and techniques and working with other people to gain
        new perspectives.
