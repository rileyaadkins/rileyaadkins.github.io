          <h2>A Little About Me...</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Riley Adkins. I am a aspiring Web-Developer in Columbus,
            OH. I am currently enrolled as a full-stack Java student at We Can
            Code IT. I come from a background of working as a licensed
            Cosmetologist since 2014. Due to my background I have been enjoying
            front-end development (CSS, HTML) because of my attention to detail
            and design. I believe I have many transferable skills to the
            development world. I enjoy keeping up with new trends and techniques
            and working with other people to gain new perspectives.
